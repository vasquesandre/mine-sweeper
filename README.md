## How It Works

At the start of the game, the player chooses the board size and how many mines will be placed.

On each turn:
1. Enter the coordinates in the format (x, y)  
2. Choose an action:
   - 1 → Open the field  
   - 2 → Mark or unmark the field

## Board Symbols

- ? → Unopened and unmarked field  
- X → Unopened and marked field  
- Numbers → Opened field with adjacent mines  
- Empty space → Opened field with no adjacent mines  
- '*' → Mines revealed when the game is lost
